"I wouldn't exactly call it a bot, so much as a 'tab and o' machine."

This is a simple LUA bot for DCSS. I mean, dead simple.. Most of the code was just grabbed from the autofight.lua directly from the DCSS source code. It basically uses 'tab', to autoattack via the ingame autofight mechanics, and uses 'o' to autoexplore via the ingame autoexplore mechanics.

It also has an emergency mode where it freaks out and tries to get 'unstuck'.

And it eats, and goes downstairs.
